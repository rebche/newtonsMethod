# Newton's Method

Created on 12/7/24 as a final project for EECE2140 (Computing Fundamentals for Engineers), this Python project is able to determine the root of any polynomial function given the derivative of the function and an interval. Additionally, a plot is created showing the sequence of approximations leading up to the convergence, which is when the root is obtained.
